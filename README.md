Hello! I am Johanna Faye A. Baldoza, you can call me Faye. I am 14 years old and study at Ateneo De Naga University Junior High School. Here is some random stuff to get to know me a little more. : )

## My Family
I have a loving father & mother and two protective brothers. They always make sure that I am safe and loved all the time. They have been one of my greatest inspirations to keep going.
